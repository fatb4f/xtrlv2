# Migration Status

Current phase: M2 (Runtime alignment + gate enforcement)
Last updated: 2026-02-14

Next 3 actions:
1. Mark M2 milestone complete and open M3 planning tasks.
2. Apply the refactoring contract (`QUALITY_REFACTORING_CONTRACT.md`) on all upcoming tooling changes.
3. Expand policy gates incrementally (type/security/changelog) after stability review.

Blockers:
- none in M2 gate-enforcement scope.
