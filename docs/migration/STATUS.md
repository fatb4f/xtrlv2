# Migration Status

Current phase: M1 (Inventory + Mapping)
Last updated: 2026-02-10

Next 3 actions:
1. Use stateless loop tick scaffold for migration supervision (`tools/migration/loop_tick.py`).
2. Review mapping classifications (PORT/REPLACE/DROP/DEFER).
3. Start M2 (entrypoint/CLI parity) once mapping is accepted.

Blockers:
- None
