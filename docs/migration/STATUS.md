# Migration Status

Current phase: M4 (Packet harness + cutover enablement)
Last updated: 2026-02-14

Next 3 actions:
1. Execute cutover sequence from `docs/migration/cutover.md` against a real migrated state root (issue `#6`).
2. Promote `migration-final-guards` to required check after one stable release cycle (issue `#7`).
3. Complete deprecation signoff for v1 operational runbooks (issue `#6`).

Blockers:
- no code blockers; production environment evidence/signoff is pending.
