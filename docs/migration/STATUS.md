Last updated: 2026-02-14

Next 3 actions:
1. Capture first failing and first passing PR run links for issue `#2` evidence.
2. Close M2-T03 after CI run evidence confirms `python-quality-gate` is green in PR context.
3. Apply the refactoring contract (`QUALITY_REFACTORING_CONTRACT.md`) on all upcoming tooling changes.

Blockers:
