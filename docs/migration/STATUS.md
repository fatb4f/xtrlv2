# Migration Status

Current phase: M6 (Migration signoff)
Last updated: 2026-02-14

Next 3 actions:
1. Monitor required checks (`ssot-gate`, `python-quality`, `final-guards`) for stability on new PRs.
2. Keep `docs/migration/final_report.md` updated for any post-signoff evidence deltas.
3. Track post-migration enhancements outside the M0–M6 migration scope.

Blockers:
- none in migration implementation/signoff scope.
